Exercise 12.11: What would happen if we called process as follows?

	process(shared_ptr<int>(p.get()));

By Faisal Saadatmand

p would be a dangling pointer after process is finished, because the copy we
passed to process was independent of p, and as such, it also had a reference
counter of 1. When it went out of scope its object--also was pointed to
by p--was deleted.
