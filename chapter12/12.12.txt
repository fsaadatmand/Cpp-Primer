Exercise 12.12: Using the declarations of p and sp explain each of the
following calls to process. If the call is legal, explain what it does. If the
call is illegal, explain why:

	auto p = new int();
	auto sp = make_shared<int>();
	(a) process(sp);
	(b) process(new int());
	(c) process(p);
	(d) process(shared_ptr<int>(p));

By Faisal Saadatmand

(a) Legal: passes a shared pointer to process. Note: sp is a nullptr
(b) Ilegal: cannot convert a raw pointer to shared_ptr<int>.
(c) Illegal: same as b, because p is a raw pointer.
(d) Legal: explicitly construct a shared pointer out of p. Note: the memory
	will be deleted and p will be a dangling pointer after process finishes.
