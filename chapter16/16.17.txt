Exercise 16.17: What, if any, are the differences between a type parameter that
is declared as a typename and one that is declared as a class? When must
typename be used?

By Faisal Saadatmand

There is not difference between typename and class. They can be used
interchangeably, with one exception. Whenever we use the scope operator with a
template type parameter to access a type name we must use typename to tell the
complier explicitly that this is a type (not a static data meme bee) we are
accessing. (p. 669-670)
