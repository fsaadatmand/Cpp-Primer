Exercise 2.37: Assignment is an example of an expression that yields a
reference type. The type is a reference to the type of the left-hand operand.
That is, if i is an int, then the type of the expression i = x is int&. Using
that knowledge, determine the type and value of each variable in this code:

int a = 3, b = 4;
decltype(a) c = a;
decltype(a = b) d = a;

By Faisal Saadatmand


c is an int, assigned the value of a
d is a reference to an int, bound to a

Values at the end of code:
a  3
b  4
c  3
d is a reference to a, which has a value of 3
