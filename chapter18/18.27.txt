Exercise 18.27: Given the class hierarchy in the box on page 810 and assuming
we add a function named foo to MI as follows:

	int ival;
	double dval;
	void MI::foo(double cval)
	{
		int dval;
		// exercise questions occur here
	}

	(a) List all the names visible from within MI::foo.
	(b) Are any names visible from more than one base class?
	(c) Assign to the local instance of dval the sum of the dval member of
		Base1 and the dval member of Derived.
	(d) Assign the value of the last element in MI::dvec to Base2::fval.
	(e) Assign cval from Base1 to the first character in sval from Derived.

By Faisal Saadatmand

(a) local dval, MI::print, MI::ival, MI::dvec, Derived::sval,
	Base1:cval, Base2::fval
(b) No
(c) dval = Base1::dval + Derived::dval;
(e) fval = dvec.back();
(f) sval[0] = cval;
