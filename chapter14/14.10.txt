Exercise 14.10: Describe the behavior of the Sales_data input operator if given
the following input:

	(a) 0-201-99999-9 10 24.95
	(b) 10 24.95 0-210-99999-9

By Faisal Saadatmand

(a) "0-201-99999-9" will be assigned to bookNo, 10 to unit_solds, and 249.50 to
	revenue.
(b) The input stream will fail at "0-210-99999-9" because it was expecting a
	double (price). Sales_data will be rest to an empty object.
