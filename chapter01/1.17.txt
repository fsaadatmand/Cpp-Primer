Exercise 1.17: What happens in the program presented in this section if the
input values are all equal? What if there are no duplicated values?
By Faisal Saadatmand

If all input values were equal, the program will print the repeated value and
how many times it was repeated in one statement. If there were no duplicate
value the program will print each value and that it occurred 1 times [sic] in
separate statements.
